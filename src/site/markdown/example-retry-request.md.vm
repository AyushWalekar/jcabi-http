# HTTP Request that Retries on Failure

[`RetryWire`](./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/http/wire/RetryWire.html).
is a decorator of
[`Wire`](./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/http/Wire.html)
that retries to fetch a response a few times before giving up and
throwing `IOException`, for example:

```java
String body = new JdkRequest("http://www.google.com")
  .through(RetryWire.class);
  .fetch()
  .body();
```

If it recommended to use this decorator in production, to avoid
accidental exceptions due to unstable connection.
